# About Sensaura

The Sensaura platform consists of three inter-related projects - the [SensNode](/pages/sensnode/about.html) hardware
platform, the [SensNet](/pages/sensnet/about.html) NRF24L01+ based networking protocol and [SensHub](/pages/senshub/about.html)
message bus service and rules engine. The components are intended to be used together to provide a scalable remote sensing
platform for home, office and manufacturing environments.

> The project is currently in the pre-alpha stage of development. at this stage there are some sample circuit designs,
> specifications for the hardware interfaces and very early prototype implementations of the software components. As an
> [open source](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/) project being developed by one person it seemed better
> to start releasing at this early stage to allow people to provide feedback and, hopefully, contribute to the development.

All elements of the framework are intended to be easily built, modified and extended by makers and hobbyists who may
not have access to professional level or commercial resources. The framework adopts a very modular approach for both
hardware and software components allowing you to concentrate on a single aspect to achieve the desired end result. The entire
system is released under the [Creative Commands Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/)
so you are free to use and modify the components for personal and commercial purposes.

# Getting Involved
