The [SensHub](/pages/senshub/index.html) server is designed to run on a number of platforms - [Mono](http://www.mono-project.com/) on Linux, the Microsoft .NET 4.5 platform in a desktop environment and the [Windows 10 IoT Core](https://dev.windows.com/en-us/iot) platform.

As part of the development process a number of tools and libraries have been developed to help achieve cross platform compatibility and simplify development process. Some of these are not specific to SensHub and would be useful for other projects as well - where possible these have been split out into separate repositories and are shared here for anyone to use.
