This is the Sensuara project, an attempt to combine a lot of smaller related projects into a single cohesive whole. The
project (and this site) is in a very early stage of development, there is no installer for you to download or even a
complete code base at this stage. I am making the project public under the [Release Early, Release Often](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Release_early,_release_often)
principle in the hopes that I can encourage contributers to join what is a very large project for a single person.

## A Brief History

Over the past year or so I have been working on a number of smaller projects that had a lot of similarities:

1. They were small, battery powered devices that were deployed around the house.
2. They sent events and accepted commands over some form of wireless communications - Bluetooth, NRF24L01 or WiFi.
3. They were often very simple and required a low pin count - enough to connect light sensors, PIR sensors and indicator LEDs.
4. All of the communication to and from the sensors was eventually vectored through an MQTT server.

The end result is a mash up of various hardware platforms (ESP8266, Bluetooth modules, Arduino and bare bones AVR or ARM
processors), project specific Python scripts to feed events into and get commands out of a MQTT server and inconsistant
naming conventions and API's.

As well as the hardware I have scripts that pull in data from external services such a Google Analytics, Twitter and GitHub
as well as pushing notifications out via Pushbullet. The whole messy combination is running on an overloaded Raspberry Pi
in my garage. It's one of those things that works but requires constant care and feeding to keep it functional.

A few months ago I decided to start designing a system that would make all of these things easier, more manageable and
more consistant. This is what became the Sensaura project.

## Project Goals

There are a few key goals that I want to achieve with the project:

1. A common but flexible hardware platform with a standard form factor.
2. A simple networking system that is isolated from my WiFi network, uses very little power and allows for different
   types of sensors to be connected without requiring custom interface code for each.
3. Simplify the interface to the MQTT server and provide an standard method to integrate sensors and external services
   as well as making the process of writing *rules* to respond to events.

These goals became the three main components of Sensuara - [SensNode](/pages/sensnode/index.html), [SensNet](/pages/sensnet/index.html)
and [SensHub](/pages/senshub/index.html) that can be used individually or together.

A full Sensaura system using all three components has a much cleaner architecture than what I have currently, the
target device for the hub is still a Raspberry Pi (or similarly specced SBC) and because MQTT is still used as the
primary message transport my existing scripts will continue to run as Sensaura gets developed.

## Current State

At the moment I am busily trying to build up this site, migrate my existing codebase into [GitHub](https://github.com/sensaura-public/)
and formalise the design for the various components. Progress will not be rapid - at the moment I am the only person
working on the project and the time I can devote to it is somewhat limited.

To start with my focus will be on the [SensNode hardware](/pages/sensnode/hardware.html) and the [SensHub](/pages/senshub/index.html)
server. I only really get to work with hardware on the weekends so focusing on the software side of things when I can't
work on hardware should help speed things up a bit.

## Desperately Seeking Collaborators

Well, maybe not desperately, but I would certainly welcome any help or feedback. Understandably there is a certain amount
of risk in getting involved in a project at such an early stage of development - once the code base and hardware designs
stabilise to the point where you can start using it in a real world environment it will be a bit safer to devote time
and energy to it.

To avoid developing in a vacuum though I have tried to make it easier to get feedback on the design and the direction
of the project - every page on the site has support for comments and I have set up a [Slack team](https://sensaura.slack.com/)
for the project (you will need an invitation to join, you can get one through the widget on the sidebar). I welcome any
feedback (positive and negative) as well as suggestions or ideas. If you can see the benefits of the project please
jump in and have your say.
